## End to End Machine Learning Project

As a data scientist, completing an end-to-end machine learning project can be a challenging but immensely rewarding experience. From data collection and preprocessing to model selection and deployment, the entire process can be complex, but it's also an excellent opportunity to showcase your skills and demonstrate your ability to deliver valuable insights and solutions.

I am thrilled to announce that I have recently completed an end-to-end machine learning project "Student Math Score Prediction". This project involved preprocessing data, exploring and analyzing the data, selecting and training appropriate models, and finally deploying in to the cloud.

I would like to thank my mentor Krish Naik Sir for sharing this project on YouTube and explaining step by step. This experience definitely helped me grow as a data scientist and gain new insights and knowledge that I can apply to future projects.
